                    <h3>Finding Nick</h3>
                    <p>I'm a big fan of Finding nick's vlogs showcasing LA's car culture and uploading daily car content. He has been my inspiration for over 5 years teaching me that it is possible to make money at a young age after a lot of hard work.</p>

                    <p>I first saw her in Blade Runner 2049, Ana de Armas plays Joi, an artificial intelligence sold by the Wallace Corporation. She's a customizable hologram that the people of Blade Runner's futuristic America can purchase as a live-in romantic partner. Had a crush on her ever since</p>

                    <p>Growing up the Pirates of the caribbean was my favorite movie and that was mainly because of the acting skills of Johnny Depp. I still know him as Jack sparrow and its hard to believe he doesn't act like that every day.</p>

                    <p>Jake Hayes is one of my favorite skaters of all time. He's technique on a skateboard is like no other being 6.2ft tall he is able to jump higher than most skaters which results in insanely high skateboarding tricks.</p>
